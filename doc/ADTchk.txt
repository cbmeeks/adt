ADTCK (ADT Transfer Checker) June 2007 update

     Usually, the transfer of the Apple II ADT program from
the PC-- the transfer you do at 300 baud-- will go fine and
ADT will get BSAVED and work like it should.  (See the
ADTPro project for a much faster way to get bootstrapped:
http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/bootstrap.html )

     In case ADT does not seem to be working correctly, you
may want to check that the transferred program was not 
corrupted. ADTCK is a short program you can type in and run
to check that you have a good copy of ADT on your Apple II.

     Type in one of the programs listed below and save it as
ADTCK on the same disk as the ADT you've transferred. Then, 
RUN ADTCK and check the numbers you get against the checksums
listed after the program. (The program displays intermediate
sums and a final sum.)

Note: Changing the saved default parameters of ADT via an 
ADTConfig program, etc. will change the checksum and render
the checksum test invalid.
