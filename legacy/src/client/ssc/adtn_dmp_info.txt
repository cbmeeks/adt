About adtn.dmp

     In a post to comp.emulators.apple2, Delfs came up with an improved way to
transfer adtgs.dmp.

     Here's an easier way to get the ADT program to the Apple II from an AT
class computer. Set up the Apple II as suggested using the IN# command from a
DOS 3.3 boot disk.  On the AT computer side, get to a DOS prompt and Change-dir
(cd) to get to the folder where the adtgs.dmp file is located. Then type the
following two lines instead of worrying about the modem software:

mode comX: baud=300 data=8 parity=n
type adtgs.dmp >comX:

Replace the "X" with the com port# (1 or 2) for the com port connected to the
Apple II.

     This method is limited to com1 or com2 on the AT class computer, but works
well across a null modem cable.  I have verified this twice, both times at the
normal speeds of the apple computers (IIe & IIgs) and using MSDOS6 and a
MSWin9x DOS window.

     This works fine for adtgs.dmp because adtgs.dmp uses the standard Apple II
line ender (just the CR character).  The adt.dmp file uses the usual PC line 
ender (CR and LF) which messes up the transfer to your Apple II using Delfs's
method.

     The file adtn.dmp is just the standard v1.22 adt.dmp file with the LF 
characters removed.

     Transfer time of adtn.dmp using Delfs's method is about 4.5 minutes.
